# Simple-KNN
Simple KNN implementation for Iris dataset.

K Nearest Neighbour(KNN) is a classification/supervised learning algorithm that is also a non-parametric and lazy-learning algorithm.Non-parametric means it doesn't make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and lazy learning means it doesn't use the traing algorithm to do any generalization.
